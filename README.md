| 5. Wind chill. Given the temperature T (in degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) as follows: w = 35.74 +0.6215 T+ (0.4275* T-¬ 35.75) *v 0.16. Write a program that takes two double command-line arguments temperature and velocity and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Note: The formula is not valid if T is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).                                                                                                                                                                                           |              |           | [Practical 5](https://classroom.github.com/a/wcXpdE0J)    | [Algorithm 5](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-5.md)    |
| 6. Write a program that prints five uniform random numbers between 0 and 1, their average value, and their minimum and maximum values. Use Math.random(), Math.min(), and Math.max().                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |              |           | [Practical 6](https://classroom.github.com/a/antGNMF2)    | [Algorithm 6](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-6.md)    |

| 11. Ramanujan’s taxi. SrinivasaRamanujan was an Indian mathematician who became famous for his intuition for numbers. When the English mathematician G. H. Hardy came to visit him one day, Hardy remarked that the number of his taxi was 1729, a rather dull number. To which Ramanujan replied, “No, Hardy! No, Hardy! It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” Verify this claim by writing a program that takes an integer command-line argument n and prints all integers less than or equal to n that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. In other words, find distinct positive integers a, b, c, and d such that a3 + b3 = c3 + d3.

| 5. Wind chill. Given the temperature T (in degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) as follows: w = 35.74 +0.6215 T+ (0.4275* T-¬ 35.75) *v 0.16. Write a program that takes two double command-line arguments temperature and velocity and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Note: The formula is not valid if T is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).                                                                                                                                                                                           |              |           | [Practical 5](https://classroom.github.com/a/q8Tmh068)    | [Algorithm 5](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-5.md)    |

| 11. Ramanujan’s taxi. SrinivasaRamanujan was an Indian mathematician who became famous for his intuition for numbers. When the English mathematician G. H. Hardy came to visit him one day, Hardy remarked that the number of his taxi was 1729, a rather dull number. To which Ramanujan replied, “No, Hardy! No, Hardy! It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” Verify this claim by writing a program that takes an integer command-line argument n and prints all integers less than or equal to n that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. In other words, find distinct positive integers a, b, c, and d such that a3 + b3 = c3 + d3.

| 5. Wind chill. Given the temperature T (in degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) as follows: w = 35.74 +0.6215 T+ (0.4275* T-¬ 35.75) *v 0.16. Write a program that takes two double command-line arguments temperature and velocity and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Note: The formula is not valid if T is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).                                                                                                                                                                                           |              |           | [Practical 5](https://classroom.github.com/a/d7Sd4nqs)    | [Algorithm 5](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-5.md)    |

| 11. Ramanujan’s taxi. SrinivasaRamanujan was an Indian mathematician who became famous for his intuition for numbers. When the English mathematician G. H. Hardy came to visit him one day, Hardy remarked that the number of his taxi was 1729, a rather dull number. To which Ramanujan replied, “No, Hardy! No, Hardy! It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” Verify this claim by writing a program that takes an integer command-line argument n and prints all integers less than or equal to n that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. In other words, find distinct positive integers a, b, c, and d such that a3 + b3 = c3 + d3.

| 5. Wind chill. Given the temperature T (in degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) as follows: w = 35.74 +0.6215 T+ (0.4275* T-¬ 35.75) *v 0.16. Write a program that takes two double command-line arguments temperature and velocity and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Note: The formula is not valid if T is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).                                                                                                                                                                                           |              |           | [Practical 5](https://classroom.github.com/a/l0VpgK0Z)    | [Algorithm 5](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-5.md)    |

| 11. Ramanujan’s taxi. SrinivasaRamanujan was an Indian mathematician who became famous for his intuition for numbers. When the English mathematician G. H. Hardy came to visit him one day, Hardy remarked that the number of his taxi was 1729, a rather dull number. To which Ramanujan replied, “No, Hardy! No, Hardy! It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” Verify this claim by writing a program that takes an integer command-line argument n and prints all integers less than or equal to n that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. In other words, find distinct positive integers a, b, c, and d such that a3 + b3 = c3 + d3. Use four nested for loops. |              |           | [Practical 11](https://classroom.github.com/a/pIVBBnPM)   | [Algorithm 11](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-11.md)   |

| 5. Wind chill. Given the temperature T (in degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) as follows: w = 35.74 +0.6215 T+ (0.4275* T-¬ 35.75) *v 0.16. Write a program that takes two double command-line arguments temperature and velocity and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Note: The formula is not valid if T is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).                                                                                                                                                                                           |              |           | [Practical 5](https://classroom.github.com/a/R3GD2tvu)    | [Algorithm 5](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-5.md)    |

| 11. Ramanujan’s taxi. SrinivasaRamanujan was an Indian mathematician who became famous for his intuition for numbers. When the English mathematician G. H. Hardy came to visit him one day, Hardy remarked that the number of his taxi was 1729, a rather dull number. To which Ramanujan replied, “No, Hardy! No, Hardy! It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” Verify this claim by writing a program that takes an integer command-line argument n and prints all integers less than or equal to n that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. In other words, find distinct positive integers a, b, c, and d such that a3 + b3 = c3 + d3.

| 5. Wind chill. Given the temperature T (in degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) as follows: w = 35.74 +0.6215 T+ (0.4275* T-¬ 35.75) *v 0.16. Write a program that takes two double command-line arguments temperature and velocity and prints the wind chill. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Note: The formula is not valid if T is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger than 120 or less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).                                                                                                                                                                                           |              |           | [Practical 5](https://classroom.github.com/a/cQhZEJBK)    | [Algorithm 5](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-5.md)    |

| 11. Ramanujan’s taxi. SrinivasaRamanujan was an Indian mathematician who became famous for his intuition for numbers. When the English mathematician G. H. Hardy came to visit him one day, Hardy remarked that the number of his taxi was 1729, a rather dull number. To which Ramanujan replied, “No, Hardy! No, Hardy! It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.” Verify this claim by writing a program that takes an integer command-line argument n and prints all integers less than or equal to n that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. In other words, find distinct positive integers a, b, c, and d such that a3 + b3 = c3 + d3. Use four nested for loops. |              |           | [Practical 11](https://classroom.github.com/a/pVmbatlh)   | [Algorithm 11](./practical-algorithms/algorithm-11.md)   |
