## Problem Statement

Write a program that, using one for loop and one if statement, prints the integers from 1,000 to 2,000 with five integers per line. Hint: Use the % operation.


## Algorithm:

    Step 1:	Start the program.
	Step 2: Create a class named FivePerLine with a main method ()
    Step 3: Inside the Main Method (), Make an inline initialization of the Variable “START=1000”, “END=1000”, and “PER_LINE=5” with the datatype integer.
    Step 4: Create a “for” loop
            a.	Do inline initialization for the loop variable “i=START”
            b.	Check the “for” loop variable “i<=END”.
            c.	Increment the “for” loop variable “i” by 1
            d.	Print the variable “i” using the System Methods
    Step 5: Use the “If” Conditional Statement to print 5 numbers per line by Checking “i+1” is divisible by the variable “PER_LINE”
    Step 6: Save the program as FivePerLine.java
	Step 7: End the program.
