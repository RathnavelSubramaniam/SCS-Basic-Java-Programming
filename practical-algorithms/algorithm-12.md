## Problem Statement

Write a program that takes an integer command-line argument n and prints all the positive powers of 2 less than or equal to n. Make sure that your program works properly for all values of n.


## Algorithm:

    Step 1: Start the program.
	Step 2: Create a class named PowersOfTwo with a main method ()
    Step 3: Inside the Main Method (), parse the command-line arguments using the variable“n” as an integer datatype.
    Step 4: Make an inline initialization of a variable “i =0”, “powerOfTwo =1” with integer Datatype.
    Step 5: Check whether the variable “i” is less than or Equal to variable “n” using the Comparative Operator using the “While” loop, 
            With in While Loop,
            i. Print the values of Variable “i” and “powerOfTwo”. 
            ii.Multiply the value of “powerOfTwo” by 2 and assign it to the variable“PowerofTwo”.
            iii.Increment the Variable “i” 	by 1 using Compound Assignment idioms
    Step 6: Save the program as PowersOfTwo.java
	Step 7: End the program.
