## Problem Statement

Write a program that takes three integer command-line arguments and prints equal if all three are equal, and not equal otherwise.


## Algorithm:

    Step 1:	Start the program.
	Step 2: Create a class named AllEqual with a main method ().
	STEP 3: Inside the Main Method (), Parse the command-line arguments using the variable  “a”, “b”, and “c” as integer datatype.
    STEP 4: Use the “If” Statement to check whether the variable “a”, and “b” is Equal and also variable “b”, and “c” is equal using the comparative operator and Boolean Operator. 
    Within If Statement.
        i.	Print “All Equal”, if the Condition is True 
        ii.	Print “Not All Equal” if the Condition is False 
    STEP 5: Save the program as AllEqual.java	
	Step 6: End the program.
